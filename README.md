# bluescreen-engine
C++ Game Engine

Built with VC++12 Compiler

/src has c++ code files

To Use: Download SFML -- this engine needs it linked and ready to go beforehand (sorry, this is hopefully temporary).
Clone this repo, and place with your source code. Include the files you need, and plug away.

This engine is very very young and changes constantly.
